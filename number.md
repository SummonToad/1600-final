# Number Conversion: Decimal, Binary, and Hexadecimal

## Understanding Binary
Binary numbers use only 0 and 1. Each digit is called a **bit**, and a group of 8 bits is called a **byte**. Computers use binary to represent all data.

### Counting in Binary
| Decimal | Binary |
|---------|--------|
| 0       | 0000   |
| 1       | 0001   |
| 2       | 0010   |
| 3       | 0011   |
| 4       | 0100   |
| 5       | 0101   |
| 6       | 0110   |
| 7       | 0111   |
| 8       | 1000   |
| 9       | 1001   |

### Decimal ↔ Binary Conversion
- **Decimal → Binary:** Divide the number by 2 repeatedly and record the remainders from bottom to top.  
- **Binary → Decimal:** Multiply each bit by 2 raised to its position index (starting from 0 on the right) and sum the results.
